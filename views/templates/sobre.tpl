              He is supposed to be the most important member of your team. Ususally this is the person who started the website. Maybe it is worth to write why he made such a desicion, what inspired him and what are his plans for the future.</li>
            <li><img src="/files/images/2page-img2.jpg" alt="" /><a href="#">Another Team Member</a><br />
              We are completly lost on what he's responsible for but we hope that you know it ;) We also hope that you will tell it to the rest of the world including us by placing some real text here. If this person has his own website this is a good place to link to it...</li>
